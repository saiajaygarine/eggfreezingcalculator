            <h2>Useful Information & Precautions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider the Risks:</strong> Egg freezing can be a safe and effective procedure, but it is not without risks. Some risks include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), infection, and damage to the ovaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Age is Crucial:</strong> The younger you are when you freeze your eggs, the higher the success rates for later use. The quality of eggs tends to decrease with age, especially after 35.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional and Financial Considerations:</strong> Egg freezing can be emotionally and financially challenging. It requires a strong commitment to your future goals, and the cost can vary depending on location and clinic.</li>
                <li><strong>Success Rates are Not Guaranteed:</strong> There is no guarantee that the frozen eggs will result in a successful pregnancy later. The success rate is influenced by factors such as egg quality, age, and health conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Consult with Experts:</strong> Speak with a fertility specialist to fully understand the procedure, potential risks, and benefits. They can guide you in making an informed decision.</li>
